## What is Query Bridge?

Query Bridge is a local-first web app that allows users to:
- Upload a CSV file or paste tabular data
- Ask natural language questions
- Get auto-generated SQL queries (requires Gemini API)
- View results directly from an in-browser database

> ⚠️ Gemini API is optional. If not configured, SQL generation and explanations will be disabled.
